# E-commerce ET Delivery App

This is a sample application that demonstrates an E-commerce website using the MERN stack. The application loads products from a MongoDB database and displays them. Users can select a shop to display products from this shop. Users can click on the 'add to cart' button and add product to a shopping cart.

# Live Demonstration

## Important!
If you don't see any shops or products when loading app for the first time - please, wait about 30 seconds. Free server needs some time to wake up...
